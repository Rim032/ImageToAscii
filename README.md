**Image To Ascii**

[----Purpose----]

This is a program that provides conversion of an image into a .txt comprising of ascii characters based on the grey scale pixels of that iamge file.

[----Reason----]

I want to mess with files and GUI more in C#. Also, I want to let some people mess around with this.

[---Misc.---]

Note: If there are any bugs/issue please let me know.
