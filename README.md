**Image To Ascii**

[----Purpose----]

This is a program that provides conversion of an image into a .txt comprising of ascii characters based on the grey scale pixels of that iamge file.
The length and width of the .txt file will be based on the length and width of the image being used.

[----Reason----]

I want to mess with files and GUI more in C#. Also, I want to let some people mess around with this.

[---Misc.---]

Note: If there are any bugs/issue please let me know.
There is a image size limit of 4096x4096.
